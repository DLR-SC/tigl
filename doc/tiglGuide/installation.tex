First you need to install the most recent version of Open Cascade to your computer. You could find a direct download link in the CPACSIntegration-Teamsite: 

\url{http://sites.kp.dlr.de/sc/CPACSIntegration/default.aspx}

Please be sure to answer "`yes"' when asked if the open cascade setup should set the environment variables. 
The \textit{\$PATH} variable is extended and a new environment variable \textit{\$CASROOT} is created which points to the OpenCASCADE installation directory. 

Since OpenCASCADE 6.3.0 there is no longer a installer for Linux. For most distributions exist native installation packages (*.deb or *.rpm format).
