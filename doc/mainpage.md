@section main_overview Overview 

The goal of TiGLCreator framework is to facilitate the processing, the editing and the creation of the 
geometric data stored inside CPACS data sets.    

TiGLCreator offers query functions for the geometry structure. 
These functions can be used for example to detect how many segments are attached to a certain segment, 
which indices these segments have, or how many wings and fuselages the current airplane configuration contains. 
This functionality is necessary because not only the modeling of simple wings or fuselages but also the 
description of quite complicated structures with branches or flaps is targeted.    

Furthermore, the TiGLCreator offers functions to modify or to create CPACS geometries. 
These functions can be used for example to modify the wing sweep angle, the fuselage length, the orientation of a section 
or to create a wing from scratch. They are necessary to avoid the manual editing of CPACS xml file.
The idea was to provide a friendly interface to CPACS geometrical data and to hide the complexity of 
the CPACS format. To do this a set of high level parameters was defined. You can find the exact definition of these 
parameters here: @subpage parameters_def .
 
The framework is release under Apache2 license.
The developed library uses the Open Source software OpenCASCADE to represent the airplane geometry by 
B-spline surfaces in order to compute surface points and also to export the geometry in the IGES/STEP/STL/VTK format. 


@section tiglcreator_structure Framework structure 

TiGL can be divided into two main blocks:

* @ref lib    
  The TiGL library is a C++ library and is really the core of TiGLCreator framework. This library contains all
  the logic of the geometrical CPACS data manipulation. The library can be accessed by other programs through 
  the TiGL API (limited functionalities) and the internal python API (full functionalities) for python programs.
  
* @ref gui    
  The TiGLCreator is a graphical user interface (GUI) to view, edit and create CPACS geometries.
  The goal of TiGLCreator is to have a friendly user interface so that aircraft designers can easily view and modify
  CPACS geometry. TiGLCreator simply calls library functions each time an object is modified and
  has convenience features to edit the file as undo/redo feature and profiles database.
  

@section functionalities Creator functionalities 

Here we will present a non-exhaustive list of the functionalities added by TiGLCreator to the TiGL project.
These functionalities are, in general, accessible through the @ref lib_python or the @ref gui. 

* Edit wing 
* Edit fuselage 
* Edit wing section 
* Edit fuselage section
* Add wing section
* Add fuselage section  
* Edit positionings
* Standardization of positionings
* Create a wing
* Create a fuselage 


@section limitations  Known limitations

* **Multiple elements per section is not supported.**
  This comes from the fact that for decomposing a matrix properly, two cpacs 
  transformations of the type scaling * rotation * translation are needed
  for each section (and not only one as required by the CPACS standard). 
* **Guide curve are not supported now.**
  So, if a wing or fuselage containing guide curves exists,
  be aware that editing the geometry can break the CPACS structure.
  Prefer to first edit/create the geometry then add the guide curve.
* **Pylons are not supported now**
* **Component segments are not fully supported now.**
  Editing a geometry that contains component segments will not break the structure, 
  but can have unwanted effect on the component.
