		and made available to you. We have taken technical and organisational measures to ensure 
		that the data protection regulations are observed both by us and by external service providers.
		</p>

		<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>

		Email: <a href="mailto:datenschutz@dlr.de">datenschutz@dlr.de</a></p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>III. Definition of terms</strong></p>

		<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act, we use the 
		following terms, among others, in this privacy policy:
		</p>

		<p><em>1. Personal data</em></p>

		<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"). 
		An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an 
		identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors 
		specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
		</p>

		<p><em>2. Data subject</em></p>

		<p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.</p>

		<p><em>3. Processing</em></p>

		<p>Processing means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, 
		whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or 
		alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, 
		alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
		</p>

		<p><em>4. Restriction of processing</em></p>

		<p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its future processing.</p>

		<p><em>5. Profiling</em></p>

		<p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate 
		certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural 
		person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location 
		or movements.
		</p>

		<p><em>6. Pseudonymisation</em></p>

		<p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed 
		to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept 
		separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to 
		an identified or identifiable natural person.
		</p>

		<p><em>7. Controller or data processing controller</em></p>

		<p>The controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency 
		or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. 
		Where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific 
		criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
		</p>

		<p><em>8. Processor</em></p>

		<p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf 
		of the controller.
		</p>

		<p><em>9. Recipient</em></p>

		<p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, 
		whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular 
		enquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients.
		</p>

		<p><em>10. Third party</em></p>

		<p>A third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, the controller, 
		the processor and the persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process the 
		personal data.
		</p>

		<p><em>11.Consent</em></p>

		<p>Consent is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or 
		she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to 
		him or her.
		</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>IV. General information on data processing</strong></p>

		<p><em>1. Scope of processing of personal data</em></p>

		<p>We only process our users' personal data to the extent necessary to provide a functional website and our content and 
		services. The processing of our users' personal data only takes place regularly with the user's consent. An exception 
		applies in cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted 
		by law.
		</p>

		<p><em>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</em></p>

		<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 
		lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, insofar as special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9 
		para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is 
		also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access 
		to information in your end device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is carried out on the basis of 
		Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and additionally on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your 
		data is required for the fulfilment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your 
		data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for the 
		fulfilment of a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried 
		out on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the 
		relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
		</p>

		<p><em>3. Data erasure and storage duration</em></p>

		<p>The personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of the processing no longer applies. 
		Data may also be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other 
		provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by 
		the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment 
		of a contract.
		</p>

		<p><em>4. Revocation of your consent to data processing</em></p>

		<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time 
		with effect for the future. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the 
		revocation.
		</p>

		<p><em>5. Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</em></p>

		<p>Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection perspective 
		non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to these non-EU 
		countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable 
		to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the 
		security agencies and you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it 
		cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal 
		data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.			
		</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>V. Processing operations</strong></p>

		<p><em>1. Server log files</em></p>

		<p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, 
		which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The type and version of browser used</li>
			<li>The used operating system</li>
			<li>Referrer URL</li>
			<li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
			<li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
			<li>The IP address</li>
		</ol>

		<p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>

		<p>This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the 
		technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to achieve this, server log 
		files must be recorded.
		</p>

		<p>The collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of data in log files is crucial to operation 
		of the website. Hence, users are not granted a right to object.
		</p>

		<p><em>2. Contact</em></p>

		<p>Contact form</p>

		<p>If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as any contact 
		information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further 
		questions. We will not share this information without your consent.
		</p>

		<p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract
		or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases the processing is based on our legitimate 
		interest in the effective processing of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your agreement 
		(Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.
		</p>

		<p>The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, 
		revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer 
		exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory 
		legal provisions, in particular retention periods.
		</p>

		<p>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</p>

		<p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) 
		will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on without your 
		consent.
		</p>

		<p>These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract 
		or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are processed on the basis 
		of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of 
		your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.
		</p>

		<p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to 
		the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory 
		provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.
		</p>

		<p><em>3) Newsletter</em></p>

		<p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as 
		information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive 
		the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. For the handling of the newsletter, we use 
		newsletter service providers, which are described below.
		</p>

		<p>Legal basis</p>

		<p>The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke any consent you have given at any time 
		by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions 
		that have taken place prior to your revocation.
		</p>

		<p>Storage period</p>

		<p>The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe 
		from the newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe 
		from the newsletter. Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.
		</p>

		<p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter 
		service provider in a blacklist, if such action is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used 
		only for this purpose and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the 
		legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the
		 blacklist is indefinite. <strong>You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong>
		</p>

		<!-- Internet Governance: [Bitte Newsletteranbieter benennen: Anbieter, Link zur Webseite] -->

		<p>Data processing</p>

		<p>We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the above-mentioned service. This is a contract mandated 
		by data privacy laws that guarantees that they process personal data of our website visitors only based on our instructions and 
		in compliance with the GDPR
	    </p>
		
		<p><strong>VI. Youtube with extended data protection</strong></p>

		<p>This website integrates videos from the YouTube website. The operator of the website is Google Ireland Limited (“Google”), 
		Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
		</p>

		<p>When you visit one of these websites on which YouTube is integrated, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. 
		This tells the YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account, you enable 
		YouTube to assign your surfing behaviour directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your 
		YouTube account.
		</p>

		<p>We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube, videos that are played in extended data protection 
		mode are not used to personalize browsing on YouTube. Ads that are played in extended data protection mode are also not 
		personalized. No cookies are set in extended data protection mode. Instead, so-called local storage elements are stored in 
		the user's browser, which contain personal data similar to cookies and can be used for recognition. Details on the extended 
		data protection mode can be found here:</p>

		<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780.</a>

		<p>After activating a YouTube video, further data processing operations may be triggered over which we have no influence.</p>

		<p>The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to 
		Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out 
		exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the 
		access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent 
		can be revoked at any time.
		</p>

		<p>For more information on how YouTube handles user data, please consult the YouTube Data Privacy Policy under:</p>

		<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en.</a>

		<p>The company is certified in accordance with the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework” (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between 
		the European Union and the US, which is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards for data 
		processing in the US. Every company certified under the DPF is obliged to comply with these data protection standards. 
		For more information, please contact the provider under the following link:

		<p><strong>VII. Rights of the data subject</strong></p>

		<p>If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR and you have the following 
		rights vis-à-vis the controller in accordance with the provisions set out below:
		</p>

		<ol type="1.">
			<li>in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR, you can <strong>request information</strong> about the personal data processed by 
			us. In particular, you can request information about the purposes of processing, the category of personal data, the 
			categories of recipients to whom your personal data has been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period and the 
			existence of the rights explained in this section 4 and 6.
			</li>
			<li> in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR, you can request the <strong>immediate correction</strong> of incorrect or 
			incomplete personal data stored by us.
			</li>
			<li>in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR, you may request <strong>the deletion</strong> of your personal data stored by 
			us, unless the processing is necessary for reasons specified by law, in particular to exercise the right to freedom 
			of expression and information, to fulfil a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the assertion, 
			exercise or even potential defence of legal claims.
			</li>
			<li>in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR, you may request <strong>the restriction of the processing</strong> of your personal 
			data if you dispute its accuracy, if the processing is unlawful but you refuse to delete it and we no longer need the 
			personal data, but you need it for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or if you have lodged an objection 
			to the processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.
