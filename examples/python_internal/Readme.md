Running the examples for the internal python api
================================================

The easiest way to install TiGL with the internal python api support is to use the
amazing [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) package manager. To install, type

    conda install -c dlr-sc tigl
    
This installs tigl and all dependencies. Then, you can run the python examples as usual.
