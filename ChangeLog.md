Changes since last release
-------------
05/08/2025
- Deprecation warning
  - The use of the node cpacsVersion right within the CPACS path /cpacs/header/ is deprecated according to CPACS 3.5. Hence, now a deprecation warning is printed if it is still used (issue #1126).


29/07/2025
- General changes
  - Remove the hard-wired gtest source code from the repository. Now, it is downloaded from GitHub and configured during the TiGL-configuration-process by default (issue #1114).
  - Raise the minimum required CMake version to 3.11 to avoid potential future deprecation errors (issue #1116).

10/07/2025
- General changes
  - Updated TiGL to new Version of [cpacs_tigl_Gen](https://github.com/DLR-SC/cpacs_tigl_gen) which is a fork from [RISCSoftware/cpacs_tigl_gen](https://github.com/RISCSoftware/cpacs_tigl_gen)
 
- Fixes
  - [#59](https://github.com/RISCSoftware/cpacs_tigl_gen/issues/59)	
    Getters by index and uID are generated now for all Elements in CPACS with Attribute: maxOccur = "unbounded".  This gives users quick
    access to elements and eliminates the need for TIGL developers to customize classes for this purpose.
  - [#1122](https://github.com/DLR-SC/tigl/issues/1122) Redo and Undo commands now update the CPACS configuration, which was previously only true for modifications using the CPACS Editor UI.
    
08/02/2025

- General changes:
  - Implemented the new CPACS fuelTanks.

- Fixes
  - #1090 Ask the user whether the currently worked on file should be saved before closing. Up to now, the configuration was simply closed resulting in potential data loss.

  - #1096 When a user adds a non-boundary segment to a wing/fuselage, the respective segment is split and a new one is created. After this split, a reordering of the segments is necessary. Otherwise, the segments cannot be lofted and created correctly. That would result in a wrong visualization and errors when trying to build them on user's demand in the tiglviewer.
For that reason, the CCPACSFuselageSegments::ReorderSegments() and CCPACSWingSegments::ReorderSegments(), respectively, were added within the call of the SplitSegment() function.
  - #752 When creating a new file out of a template, the CPACSCreator automatically creates a new `.temp` file in the template directory. It might be the case that the user does not have write access to this directory, e.g. when TiGL is not configured and built but just downloaded via the installer. On the other hand it does not seem to be reasonable to directly create and store (!) a new file every time the 'new file' command is activated. Now, no temporary file is created. The content of the wanted template is copied into a string which then will be opened and read by tixi. Only if wanted, the resulting and edited CPACS file is stored.
  - #1087 CPACSCreator uses a system-wide config file to store (among many others) the path to the profiles database. If TiGL is built in a second configuration on the same system, the first build will determine the path in this config file. If then later the first build (and path) is removed, TiGL will still try to load the database from this path. A check is included, whether the path exists and should overwrite the config file entry when it does not.

  - #1094 Fix inconsistent parametrization of super ellipse profiles. Before, the super ellipses ware parametrized by arc length, which resulted in 
    different parameters at the four distinct points of the super ellipse. Potential kinks in two super ellipses were not necessarily connected by a
    v-isoline in the resulting loft. This has been fixed.
  - #936 A particular defined positioning (of the C++-type CCPACSPositioning) was not available via Python bindings since the std::vector<std::unique_ptr<**Type**>> is not exposed to swig. New getter functions have been implemented in CCPACSPositioning.h to make these elements accesible via index, similar to the implementation of for several other classes. For more information see https://github.com/RISCSoftware/cpacs_tigl_gen/issues/59.

 - New API functions:
   
   - New function `::tiglComponentTransformPointToGlobal` to transform component-local coordinates into global coordinates (#1064)
  
 - General changes:

    - Add support for OpenCascade Technology 7.8.
    - Update the C++ standard to C++17 (#1045).
    - Added the possibility to switch between two algorithms in the `CCSTCurveBuilder`. The default algorithm based on a Chebychev approximation results in a small number of control points, but introduces small discontinuities in the curvature. The new option is to use OCCT's `GeomAPI_PointsToBSpline`, which results in a C3 continuous B-Spline.


13/11/2024

 - Fixes:
   - In #1026, the tolerance for creating cells via contourCoordinate was reduced for cells in spanwise direction. That fixed a bug that caused cells to overlap potentially. The same reduction was missed in chordwise direction and is added now to avoid the cell overlap in chordwise direction, as well. (#1034)


Version 3.4.0
-------------
12/11/2024

 - General changes:

   - Support CPACS 3.4 (#1027)
   - Implemented standard fuselage profiles, i.e. rounded rectangle profiles (#1005) and superellipses (#1021).
   - CPACS allows prescribing kinks at (fuselage) profiles at given parameters. At the same time, guide curves must be prescribed at a relative circumference of the profile, which does not necessarily coincide with the parametrization of the profiles. In consequence, it was nearly impossible for a user to prescribe a guide curve exactly at a profile kink. This was fixed by allowing guide curves to be placed at a curve parameter that coincides with the prescribed parameter in the profile definition. Now guide curves can optionally be prescribed using `fromParameter ` and `toParameter` instead of `fromRelativeCircumference` and `toRelativeCircumference`. (#1015)
  
 - Fixes:
   - In Debug Mode, the Lofting algorithm now throws an exception, if the generation of the Side Caps fail. The intention behind having the check only in Debug-Mode is that the geometric validity check is very generic and may be too restrictive. In addition, it may be expensive. (#999)
   - Fixed an issue, where approximate reparametrization of a B-Spline Curve resulted in non-negligable geometric changes of the B-Spline, especially if parameters are prescribed for a profile in CPACS. This new reparametrization is incompatible with a previous reparametrization applied to fuselage profiles, that distributed the knots for an overall cleaner geometry. Now the knot distribution is turned off, if parameters are prescribed in CPACS. (#1007)
   - CPACS 3.5 introduces a new way of prescribing the version of the CPACS data set, which means that newer CPACS files could not be interpreted by TiGL anymore. Now, TiGL can open CPACS 3.5 files and raises a warning that the CPACS version is newer than the one supported by TiGL (#1010).
   - Fix hard crash in Wing Geometry generation with cutouts, if there are no cutouts defined in CPACS. (#1023) 

Version 3.3.1
-------------
14/03/2024

 - General changes:

   - Improve documentation and update installation instructions.
   - TiGL now supports Opencascade Technology 7.6.2 (#973).
   - Extension of the functionality of `::tiglwinginterpolatexsi` to work on a single segment that is not part of a component segment (#970). The function
   is now generalized, so that the start and end uid can be either a segment or component segment and the two do not have to be related to each other.
   - TiGL now supplies an environment.yml file that can be used with conda to install all build requirements of tigl into an Anaconda environment.
   - Renamed the function `::CCPACSConfiguration::GetAirplaneLenth` to `::CCPACSConfiguration::GetAirplaneLength` (#992).
   
 - Fixes:

   - Fix bug in guide curve transformation. The rX-Direction was wrongly interpreted with respect to global coordinates, not wing coordinates (#975).
   - Fix for hard crash if guiceCurves node is present but empty in wing segment (#962).
   - Fix bug related to the calculation of Euler angles from a given rotation matrix (#870).

 - TiGLViewer:

   - Improved visual quality of zebra stripes (#974).


Version 3.3.0
-------------
02/05/2023

 - General changes:

   - Support CPACS 3.3 (#883). The following CPACS 3.3 functionality is not yet supported: stringerFramePosition definition at fuselage section (#915), landing gears (#908), parametric fuselage profiles (#909). 
   - Implemented the upcoming CPACS 3.5 feature for modeling ducts. It allows the user to create duct cutouts in        wings and fuselages. TiGL was extended to support ducts and duct assemblies for aircraft configurations. It is      to mention, that currently wings and fuselages are the only components that enable duct cutouts (#881).
   - Generate doxygen documentation for all classes, not just the API functions (#943).
 
 - New API functions:

   - New functions `::tiglConfigurationSetWithDuctCutouts` and `::tiglConfigurationGetWithDuctCutouts` that set and      get the flag whether the ducts defined in CPACS shall be removed from the configuration using Boolean operations. 
   - New function #::tiglGetCrossSectionArea' that allows cutting either a whole configuration or single parts with a plane and calculating the cross section area. This functionality can be used for the application for Whitcomb's area rule (#763). 
 
 - Fixes:

   - Adapt get_tigl_tixi.sh to properly download the tixi3 package for debian (#884).
   - Export fuselages and wings as a whole and not segmentwise in the CAD export of the unfused configuration (#897).
   - Fix typos (#923, #924, #925).
   - Fix bug concerning the conversion of the internal parametrization of the faces of a wing to contour coordinates (#930).
   - Update CI (#918, #839).
   - Fix a compilation error with gcc 12.2 (#948).
   - Fix bug in `::tiglWingGetSegmentUpperSurfaceAreaTrimmed` (#961).

 - TiGLViewer:

   - Implement high dpi screen support (#953).

Version 3.2.3
-------------
09/03/2022

- Fixes:

  - Disabled check, if wing cells can be trimmed rather than cut, even if they are not defined
    by contour coordinates. This check was put in place for better performance and robustness, 
    because with trimmed curves expensive and error-prone boolean operations can be avoided.
    However, the current implementation of the check relies on some hard to tune tolerances and
    led to false positives and thus faulty wing cell geometries (issues #865, #869).
  - Fixed a bug, where the trailing edge of a wing cell could not be defined by referencing a
    spar (issue #864).
  - The class `::CCPACSEnginePosition` has been added to the swig interface (issue #858). Without 
    this it was previously impossible to access the transformed engine nacelle geometrie from Python.

Version 3.2.2
-------------
17/11/2021

- Highlights / General changes:

  - Added support for canard style flaps. This allows to position the hinge points
    outside of the wing by providing an additional translation vector (issue #816).

- Fixes:

  - Fixed CPACS versions header not correctly parsed, if the version number contained a patch version (issue #830).
  - Fixed multiple errors that occured during the computation of wing cells (issues #815, #829, #840).
  - Fixed computation of the wing aspect ratio (issue #827).
  - Fixed crashes in TiGL Viewer when displaying control surface devices (issue #851).
  - Improved robustness of export functions. The export now tries to export as much as possible,
    even if one component failed to built (issue #853).

- Bindings:
  - Added python 3.9 conda packages 
  - Fixed loading python bindings with python 3.8 due to a changed DLL loading policy (issue #842).
  - Fixed a crash in the python bindings due to wrong memory handling (issue #823).

Version 3.2.1
-------------
01/07/2021

- Fixes:

  - Fixed function `::tiglWingGetSegmentEtaXsi` ignoring the GetPointBehaviour that was introduced in TIGL 3.1.0: Since TiGL 3.0.0, the getPoint functions
    now use the parametrization of the wing surface geometries instead . This behaviour can be switched back to the old bevahiour using `::tiglWingSetGetPointBehavior`.
    Before fixing now `::tiglWingGetSegmentEtaXsi`, the functions always used the old behaviour such that the back and fort computation etaXsi -> point -> etaXsi
    did not result in the same values. 

Version 3.2.0
-------------
28/05/2021

 - Highlights / General changes:
 
   - Full support of CPACS 3.2
   - TiGL 3.2 is shipped with OpenCASCADE 7.4.0 and is now compatible with pythonOCC 7.4.0. This includes all TiGL releases and Conda packages.
   - Improved computation speed of wing cell geometries.
   - Implemented cell definition with contour coordinates. This feature will be part of CPACS 3.4.
   - A new curve / curve intersection algorithm. This is used e.g. for the computation of curve network interpolation and was necessary due to a regression in OpenCASCADE 7.4.0. The new algorithm is designed to find all intersections between two curves within a user defined tolerance.
   
   

 - New API functions:
  
   - New function `::tiglWingInterpolateXsi`, that generalizes the functions `::tiglWingComponentSegmentGetSegmentIntersection` and `::tiglWingComponentSegmentComputeEtaIntersection`. Both old functions are now deprecated.

 - Fixes:
  
  - Fixed fuselage walls transformation that did not respect the fuselage transformation before.
  - Fixed fuselage profiles, that had different positions than y=0 at start or end point.
  - Fixed crash, if first guide curve point is (0,0,0) or last point is (0,1,0).
  - Fixed wrong position of trailing edge device borders, if referenceUID is referring to a segment.
  - Fixed a bug in `::tiglWingGetUpperPoint` and `::tiglWingGetLowerPoint`, if the leading edge has zero size.

 
 - Python Bindings:
   
   - The tigl3 Conda packages depend not on pythonOCC-core 7.4.0. If you plan to migrate your code, please notice that pythonOCC and TiGL don't use OpenCASCADE handles anymore. For more insights, please see here: https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/pull/583
 

Version 3.1.0
-------------
27/07/2020

 - General changes:

   - Full support of CPACS 3.1
   - Backport support for control surface devices from TiGL 2. It is now possible to manipulate trailing edge devices
     with TiGL 3.1 using the TiGL Viewer, the API or the language bindings.
   - Added support for fuselage walls
   - Support for fuselage profiles with kinks.
   - Added support for new symmetry flags `inherit` and `none`. The symmetry flag `inherit` causes a geometric
     component to inherit the symmetry flag from its parent geometry. This was and still is the default behavior in
     TiGL. The new symmetry type `none` allows the addition of components to mirrored geometries without respecting the
     symmetry of the parent.
   - Substantially improve performance of `::tiglCheckPointInside`.
   - Reduce complexity of the fuselage geometry: The profiles of the fuselage are reparametrized to create simpler a
     B-spline surface. This will improve robustness of boolean operations and increase the general performance at the
     cost of a small error in the geometry creation, that should be negligable in most cases.

 - New API functions:

   - Added new api function ``::tiglComponentGetType``
   - For control devices, the `deflection` value has been renamed to `control_parameter`. Therefore the functions
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetMinimumDeflection`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetMaximumDeflection`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetDeflection`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceSetDeflection`
     
     are marked as deprecated. Please use the new functions

     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetMinimumControlParameter`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetMaximumControlParameter`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceGetControlParameter`
     - `::tiglControlSurfaceSetControlParameter`
     
     instead.


 - Fixes:

   - Fixes compilation errors with MinGW and VS 2019
   - Fixes compilation errors with qt4
   - Fixes compilation errors with OpenCascade 7.4.0 and OCCT 7.2
   - Several fixes to internal python bindings
   - Several fixes to control devices code.
   - Fixes invalid segment meta data in VTK export
   - fixing problem in ReadCPACS when using rotors (invalidation during read of segments caused error in lazy creation of attached rotor blades)

 - TiGLViewer:

   - Back-ported control surfaces to TiGL Viewer and improved design of flap dialog.
   - Added option to draw face boundaries in TiGl Viewer


Version 3.0.0
-------------
24/09/2019

 - General Changes:

    - CPACS 3 compatibility, including the new component-segment coordinate-system definition.
   The new cpacs definition of the wing structure allows more precise modelling of ribs and spars.
    - Guide curve support for wings and fuselages for high-fidelity surface modeling according to the CPACS 3 defintion.
    - __Note: TiGL 3 does not yet contain the control surface device modeling. This will be included into TiGL 3.1.__
    - New modeling of nacelles.
    - New modeling of pylons.
    - New modeling of fuselage structure elements like doors, beams, frames and pressure bulkheads.
    - Automated creation of CPACS reading and writing routines. This allows much
   better vality checks of the CPACS document.
    - The "GetPoint" function of wings / fuselages operate now on the actual wing/fuselage shape (e.g. in case of guide curves). Before, these function operated
   on the linear loft, which is different from the actual shape. To be backwards compatible, ``::tiglWingGetUpperPoint``, ``::tiglWingGetLowerPoint``, and ``::tiglFuselageGetPoint``  still use the linear loft by default.
   If the actual smooth surface is desired, the new function ``::tiglWingSetGetPointBehavior`` and ``::tiglFuselageSetGetPointBehavior`` must be used to enable smooth lofts.
   __Note: Using the actual smooth wing shape, ``::tiglWingGetUpperPoint`` and ``::tiglWingGetLowerPoint`` do not use the wing chord surface anymore as a reference coordinate system, but relies on the wing surface parametrization.__
   __This change was required, since there would be no other way to retrieve points around the leading edge, that is on front of the trapezoidal chord surface.__
    - Improved speed of ``::tiglFuselageGetPoint`` function. Also, the paramter xsi is now interpreted as the relative
   curve parameter instead of the relative circumference.
    - Improved robustness of fuselage loft computation.
    - The TIGL library was renamed to tigl3. The TIGLViewer was renamed to tiglviewer-3.
    - The windows builds are now using the Visual C++ 2015 Toolchain.
    - TiGL now requires a C++ 11 capable compiler. Minimum required compilers are gcc 4.8 or Visual C++ 2015.


 - New API functions:

   - ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetEtaXsi`` computes the eta/xsi coordinates of a point on the component segment.
   - ``::tiglIntersectWithPlaneSegment`` computes the intersection of a CPACS shape (e.g. wing) with a plane of finite size.
   - ``::tiglGetCurveIntersection`` to compute the intersection of two curves.
   - ``::tiglGetCurveIntersectionPoint`` to query the intersection point(s) computed by ``::tiglGetCurveIntersection``.
   - ``::tiglGetCurveIntersectionCount`` returns the number of intersection points computed by ``::tiglGetCurveIntersection``.
   - ``::tiglGetCurveParameter`` projects a point onto a curve and returns the curve parameter of the point.
   - ``::tiglFuselageGetSectionCenter`` computes the center of a fuselage section defined by its eta coordinate.
   - ``::tiglFuselageGetCrossSectionArea`` computes the area of a fuselage section.
   - ``::tiglFuselageGetCenterLineLength`` computes the length of the centerline of the fuselage.
   - ``::tiglCheckPointInside`` checks, whether a point lies inside some object (defined by its uid).
   - ``::tiglExportFuselageBREPByUID`` and ``::tiglExportWingBREPByUID``
   - ``::tiglSetExportOptions`` sets exports-specific options
   - ``::tiglFuselageSetGetPointBehavior`` and  ``::tiglWingSetGetPointBehavior`` to adjust, whether the get point functions should return linear loft values or points on the actual shape.
	  - ``::tiglSetDebugDataDirectory`` specifies the directory of the crashdump data.
  
 - Changed API:

   - Removed deprectated intersection functions. These include
    - ``tiglComponentIntersectionLineCount``
    - ``tiglComponentIntersectionPoint``
    - ``tiglComponentIntersectionPoints``
   - Removed function ``tiglExportVTKSetOptions``. This is now replaced by ``::tiglSetExportOptions``
	  - ``tiglWingGetWettedArea`` now returns surface area of the wing, if the wing has no parent. Previously this caused a crash.

 - Fixes:

   - TiGL Viewer: Fixed missing fonts on macOS

 - Language bindings:

   - New python bindings allow to access the whole C++ API of TiGL. This bindings can be installed via conda. 
   - Python: the tiglwrapper.py module was renamed to tigl3wrapper.py. The Tigl object is renamed to Tigl3.
   - Java: the tigl package moved from de.dlr.sc.tigl to de.dlr.sc.tigl3

 - TiGL Viewer:

    - Display of reflection lines to inspect surface quality.
    - Display of textured surfaces.
    - Angle of perspective can be adjusted using the scripting API with ``setCameraPosition`` and ``setLookAtPosition``.
   This allows e.g. to create videos of the geometry.
    - Option to display face names.
    - Number of U and V iso-lines can be adjusted independently.
    - New design

Version 2.2.3
--------------
28/06/2018

 - New API functions:

   - Backport API function ``tiglCheckPointInside`` that checks wether a point lies inside a given geometric object
   - New API function ``tiglGetGuideCurvePoints`` to obtain the guide curve points on the fuselage/wing for a given guide curve.


Version 2.2.2
--------------
11/04/2018

 - General changes:

   - Modelling of control surfaces as trailing and leading edge devices
   - The wing is now written a one entity instead of several segments in the file exports 
 
 - New API functions:

   - ``tiglControlSurfaceGetDeflection`` to query the deflection of the given control surface device
   - ``tiglControlSurfaceSetDeflection`` to set the deflection of the given control surface device
   - ``tiglGetControlSurfaceCount`` to get the number of control surface devices
   - ``tiglGetControlSurfaceType`` to query the type of the control surface device (leading + trailing edge device)
   - ``tiglGetControlSurfaceUID`` to query the UID of the control surface device
   - ``tiglControlSurfaceGetMinimumDeflection`` and ``tiglControlSurfaceGetMaximumDeflection`` to
    get the minimum and maximum deflection of the control surface device

 - Fixes:

   - Fixed bug JAVA bindings getProfileSplines (issue #357)
  
 - TiGLViewer:

   - The control surface devices can be extended and retracted from inside the GUI
   - Added functions to set camera positions. The following functions where added:
     - setLookAtPosition(x, y, z)
     - setCameraPosition(elevationAngle, azimuthAngle)
They can be used from the console to e.g. create movies. 


Version 2.2.1
--------------
18/08/2017

 - General changes:

   - Improved calculation time of ``::tiglFuselageGetPointAngle`` by roughly a factor of 30. The results might be a different than in previous versions, but the function should be more robust now.
   - Improved calculation time of ``::tiglFuselageGetPoint`` by applying caching. This leads only to a benefit in case of a large number of GetPoint calls (~30) per fuselage segment. This will be even improved in TiGL 3.

 - New API functions:

   - New API function ``tiglExportVTKSetOptions``. This function can be used e.g to disable
    normal vector writing in the VTK export.

 - Changed API:

   - Ignore Symmetry face in ``::tiglFuselageGetSurfaceArea`` for half fuselages
   - In ``::tiglFuselageGetPointAngle`` the cross section center is used as starting point of the angle rather than the origin of the yz-plane

 - Fixes:

   - Fixed bug, where the VTK export showed no geometry in ParaView
   - Improved accuracy of the VTK export. The digits of points are not truncated anymore to avoid duplicate points
   - Triangles with zero surface are excluded from the VTK export
   - Fixed incorrect face name ordering in WingComponentSegment

Version 2.2.0
--------------
23/12/2016

 - Major changes:

   - Added modelling of the wing structure, including ribs and spars . This code was part of a large
    pull request by Airbus D&S. Currently, the structure is only accessible by the TiGL Viewer.
    In future releases, we plan to make the structure accessible from the API.
   - Improved Collada export: The export is now conforming with the collada schema
    and can be displayed with OS X preview.
   - External shapes are added to the exports.
   - Added writing of modified CPACS files. Still, we do not offer yet API functions
    for modifications. Using the internal API, modifications are already possible.

 - New API functions:

   - New API function ``::tiglSaveCPACSConfiguration`` for writing the CPACS configuration into a file.

 - TiGLViewer:

   - Visualization of the wing structure.
   - Improved linking and compilation with Qt.
   - Added STL export of the whole aircraft configuration.


Version 2.1.7
--------------
22/09/2016

 - General changes:

   - Support for generic aircraft systems (by Jonas Jepsen).
   - External components are now conforming with the CPACS 2.3 standard (by Jonas Jepsen).
   - Support for rotorcraft (by Philipp Kunze).
   - Improved IGES export: Added support for long names in IGES (more than 8 characters as before).
   - Removed support for RedHat 5 and Ubuntu 13.10.
   - Added support for RedHat 7.
   - Ported to OpenCASCADE 6.9.0 and 7.0.0.

 - New API functions:

   - ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentComputeEtaIntersection``: This function should be used to compute points on the wing
     that lie on a straight line between two given points.
   - ``::tiglFuselageGetIndex`` to compute the index based on the fuselage UID.
   - Added new API functions for rotors and rotor blades:
     - ``::tiglGetRotorCount``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetUID``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetIndex``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetRadius``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetReferenceArea``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetTotalBladePlanformArea``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetSolidity``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetSurfaceArea``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetVolume``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetTipSpeed``
     - ``::tiglRotorGetRotorBladeCount``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetWingIndex``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetWingUID``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetAzimuthAngle``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetRadius``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetPlanformArea``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetSurfaceArea``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetVolume``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetTipSpeed``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetLocalRadius``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetLocalChord``
     - ``::tiglRotorBladeGetLocalTwistAngle``

 - Fixes:

   - Fixed parent-child transformations in case of multiple root components.
   - Fixed an error in ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentGetPoint`` in case of multiple intersections of the eta plane with the wing. 
    This was the case for e.g. box wings. (issue #176).
   - Fixed bug ``::tiglWingGetSpan`` in wing span computation when no wing symmetry is given (e.g. for a VTP) (issue #185 and #195).
   - Fixed another bug in ``::tiglWingGetSpan`` when the symmetry plane was the Y-Z plane (issue #174).
   - Fixed incorrect result in ``::tiglWingGetSegmentEtaXsi`` near wing sections, returning the wrong section (issue#187).
   - Fixed an issue in ``::tiglWingGetSegmentEtaXsi`` in case the airfoil is completely above the chord surface.
   - Fixed point projection on the geometry for large scale data (eg a factor of 1000) by making the convergence criterium size dependent (issue #203).

 - TiGLViewer:

   - Visualization of rotorcraft and rotorcraft specific menus.
   - Visualization of generic aircraft systems.
   - Added ``wingGetSpan`` function to TiGLViewer scripting.
   - Added script function ``wingComponentSegmentGetPoint``.
   - Fixed tiglviewer.sh script loading wrong OpenCASCADE libraries.

 - Language bindings:

   - Started experimental python bindings for the internal API.
    This allows a direct manipulation of the geometry objects
    from python together with the OpenCASCADE python bindings (pythoncc).
   - The source code of the matlab bindings is now shipped on all systems. In addition,
    we distribute a Makefile which can be used to compile the Matlab bindings when needed.
   - Added function ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentComputeEtaIntersection`` to java bindings.


Version 2.1.6
-------------
15/07/2015

 - TiGL Viewer:

   - Fixed critical crash on Windows 64 bit systems that occured sporadically on some systems


Version 2.1.5
-------------
01/07/2015

 - Changed API:

   - Added an output argument in the function ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsi`` that returns the error of the computation.
   - The function ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentGetSegmentIntersection`` uses a new algorithm that should ensure straight 
    flap leading edges and straight spars. Also, a new parameter ``hasWarning`` was added, to inform the user, that the
    returned segment xsi value is not in the valid range [0,1]. This might be the case, if a spar is partially located outside the wing.
   - Removed macros TIGL_VERSION and TIGL_VERSION_MAJOR from tigl.h. Please use tigl_version.h instead.

 - General changes:

   - External geometries can be included into the CPACS file using a link to a STEP file. The allows e.g. the use
    of engines and nacelles. (Note: this is not yet included in the CPACS standard)
   - Improved computation of half model fuselage profiles. Now, fuselages are c2 continuous at the symmetry plane.
   - Improved computation speed of ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentGetPoint`` by a factor of 30 to 600 (depending on the geometry).
   - Reduced execution time of ``::tiglOpenCPACSConfiguration``.
   - All TiXI messages (errors/warnings) are now printed to the TiGL log.
   - Ported to OpenCASCADE 6.8.0.

 - New API functions:

   - ``::tiglExportFusedBREP`` to export the fused configuration to the BRep file format.

 - Fixes:

   - Fixed bug, where guide curves on half model fuselages were not touching the symmetry plane.
   - Fixed a TIGL_MATH_ERROR bug in ``::tiglWingComponentSegmentGetSegmentIntersection``.

 - TiGL Viewer:

   - Ported to Qt 5.
   - OpenGL accelerated rubber band selection. This fixes the slow rubber band selection on Linux and 
    the invisible rubber band selection on Mac.

   - Improved computation of fuselage positionings. This should improve loading times of configurations 
    with large number of sections, since the algorithmic complexity is reduced.
   - IGES + STEP export: All wing faces are now classified as Top-Wing, Bottom-Wing, or Trailing-Edge.
   - IGES export: Changed units to mm.
   - IGES export: Implemented layers/levels .
