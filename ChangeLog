Version 2.1.5
-------------

    - Changed API:
        - Added an output argument in the function ``tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsi`` that returns the error of the computation
        - The function``tiglWingComponentSegmentGetSegmentIntersection`` uses a new algorithm that should ensure straight 
          flap leading edges and straight spars. Also, a new parameter ``hasWarning`` was added, to inform the user, that the
          returned segment xsi value is not in the valid range [0,1]. This might be the case, if a spar is partially located outside the wing.

    - General changes:
        - External geometries can be included into the CPACS file using a link to a STEP file. The allows e.g. the use
          of engines and nacelles. (Note: this is not yet included in the CPACS standard)
        - Improved computation of half model fuselage profiles. Now, fuselages are c2 continuous at the symmetry plane.
        - Improved computation speed of ``tiglWingComponentSegmentGetPoint`` by a factor of 30 to 600 (depending on the geometry).
        - Reduced execution time of ``tiglOpenCPACSConfiguration``.
        - All TiXI messages (errors/warnings) are now printed to the TiGL log.
        - Ported to OpenCASCADE 6.8.0

    - New API functions:
        - ``tiglExportFusedBREP`` to export the fused configuration to the BRep file format.

    - Fixes:
        - Fixed bug, where guide curves on half model fuselages were not touching the symmetry plane.
        - Fixed a TIGL_MATH_ERROR bug in ``tiglWingComponentSegmentGetSegmentIntersection``.

    - TiGL Viewer:
        - Ported to Qt 5.
        - OpenGL accelerated rubber band selection. This fixes the slow rubber band selection on Linux and 
          the invisible rubber band selection on Mac.
        - Fixed bug when loading a CPACS file with multiple models.
        - Removed support for legacy VRML and CSDFB files.

          were replaced by ``tiglWingGetUpperPointAtDirection`` and ``tiglWingGetLowerPointAtDirection``.

        - Accurate B-Spline approximation of CST curves using Chebychev approximation.

        - Implemented trimming of intersection curves with parent bodies and far fields
        - Improved computation of fuselage positionings. This should improve loading times of configurations

        - Changed behavior of ``tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsi``. If the specified point lies outside
          any segment so that the transformation can not be executed, ``TIGL_MATH_ERROR`` is returned.
        - The following API functions ``tiglComponentIntersectionPoint``, ``tiglComponentIntersectionPoints`` 
          and ``tiglComponentIntersectionLineCount`` are deprecated and will
          be removed in future releases. These functions are replaced by new intersection routines.
        - Removed functions ``tiglExportStructuredIGES`` and ``tiglExportStructuredSTEP``

    - General changes:
        - Completely reworked boolean operations with the following effects:

            - Fusing the whole plane is faster in many cases and more reliable
            - We keep track of the origins of each trimmed face which helps for
              the IGES and STEP exports
            - The boolean operations can be debugged now by setting the environment variable TIGL_DEBUG_BOP

        - Completely rewritten STEP and IGES exports:

        - Added method to export wing and fuselage profiles and guide curves to BREP
        - Fixed incorrect units in IGES and STEP export from save-as dialog.
        - General save-as dialog: All visible objects are saved to the file, if no shape is selected. 
          Otherwise, only the selected objects are exported.
        - Added debugging parameters to settings dialog. This includes:

            - Adapting number of displayed iso lines per face
            - Display face numbers
            - Debug boolean operations (if enabled, debugging shapes in BRep format are stored 
              to the current working directory)

        - Added new dialog for shape/shape and shape/plane intersections.
        - Added drag and drop support to TiGLViewer. Files (CPACS, IGES, STEP, BREP) are opened when they are dragged into TiGLViewer.
        - TiGLViewer displays far field after calculating the trimmed aircraft
        - Iso U/V lines are no longer displayed by default. This can be changed in the settings dialog.
        - The fused/trimmed aircraft geometry is displayed using a different color for each component.
        - Added visualization of wing and fuselage guide curves.
        - Fix: Only the first intersection curve was displayed. This is fixed now.

Version 2.0.1
-------------
Released: 02/10/2012

    - General Changes:
        - Fixed geometry transformations like sweep angle and dihedral angle rotating sections
        - Fixed scalings that lead to a translation of sections
        - Datasets with CPACS Version < 2.0 are now rejected
        - Calculation of fused fuselage, wing, and airplane should not crash anymore
        - Removed memory leaks
        - Cmake based project files
        - Prepared for OpenCascade? 6.5.3
        - Windows 64 Bit builds available
    
    - TiGLViewer:
        - Fixed inconsistent hot keys and menu entries for views
        - Console window showing outputs of TIGL and OpenCascade?
        - Wireframe mode
        - Recent Documents menu entry


Version 2.0
-----------

    - General Changes:
        - Compatible with CPACS 2.0
        - Corrected the implicit rotation of fuselage and wing profiles. They shouldn't turn from x-y to x-z by TIGL
        - TIGL now uses the coordinate system of parent components for child components. This is only done when parent --> child 
          relations could be figured out via UIDs.
        - Profile points could now also be stored as the vector (x ,y, and z) containing all profile points.
        - Some XPath have changed in CPACS 2.0, for example "sweepangle" is now "sweepAngle". TIGL is taking care of these changes.

    - New API Functions:
        - ``tiglFuselageGetSymmetry`` and ``tiglWingGetSymmetry`` for querying symmetry information
        - ``tiglWingGetReferenceArea`` gives the reference area of a wing
        - ``tiglWingComponentSegmentFindSegment`` returns the segmentUID and wingUID for a given point on a componentSegment
        - ``tiglWingGetWettedArea`` a new function for caluclating wetted area of a wing
        - ``tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsireturns`` eta, xsi, segmentUID and wingUID for a given eta and xsi on 
              a componentSegment
    
    - TiGLViewer:
        - Complete rebuild of TIGLViewer. It is now QT based and platform independent
        - TIGLViewer now updates the view when the cpacs file is changed.


Version 1.0
-----------
Released: 31/08/2011

    - Changed API:
        - ``tiglOpenCpacsConfiguration`` now opens a configuration without specification if the uid if it is the only one 
          in the data set. Simply take NULL or en empty string as uid argument.
        - Added a Python wrapper for the C-code and DLL handling (no need to manually convert cpython variables to python)

    - New API Functions
        - ``tiglComponentIntersectionPoint`` Returns a point on the intersection line of two geometric components. Often 
          there are more one intersection line, therefore you need to specify the line.
        - ``tiglComponentIntersectionLineCount`` Returns the number if intersection lines of two geometric components.
        - ``tiglComponentGetHashCode`` Computes a hash value to represent a specific shape. The value 
          is computed from the value of the underlying shape reference and the Orientation is not taken into account.
        - ``tiglFuselageGetMinumumDistanceToGround`` Returns the point where the distance between the selected fuselage 
          and the ground is at minimum. Fuselage could be turned with a given angle at at given axis, specified by a 
          point and a direction.

    - TIGLViewer
        - now could draw the componentSegment of a selected wing.


Version 0.9
-----------
Released: 29/04/2011

    - General Changes:
        - Fixed a bug that leads to strange errors when the first positioning of a Wing is not in the origin and has not 
          innerSectionUID-element.
        - Removed annoying strErr message when a point miss one parameter.
        - TIGL 64-Bit libs are available for linux.
        - TIGL is now able to open rotocraft configurations as well as aircraft
