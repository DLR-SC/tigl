Version 2.0.3
---------------
- New API Functions:
	- tiglWingGetIndex Returns the wing index given a wing UID
	- tiglWingGetSegmentIndex Returns the segment index given a wing segment UID
	- tiglWingGetComponentSegmentCount Returns the number of component segments for a specific wing (selected by wing index)
	- tiglWingGetComponentSegmentIndex Translates component segment UID into component segment index
	- tiglWingGetComponentSegmentUID Translates component segment index into component segment UID
- Fixes:
	- Fixed tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsi

	- Fixed memory management handling of tiglWingGetProfileName
	- Fixed memory leaks in VTK export
	- Fixed memory leak in CCPACSFuselages
- TIGLViewer:
	- Menus are enabled/disabled depending on number of wings/fuselages
	- Added close configuration menu entry
	- improved view rotation with middle mouse button
- Added CCPACSWingSegment::GetChordPoint to internal API
- Added a simple cpacs data set for accuracy testing
- Added some accuracy tests for getPoint functions
- Added support for visual leak detector
- Changed UnitTesting? Framework to google-test
- Changed tigl linking to static for unit tests
- Added coverage with gcov (gcc only) to project


Version 2.0.2
-Fixed wing translation bug in TIGLViewer and export Functions
-Implemented STL import
-The result of the fused plane calculation is now chached 

-TIGLViewer:
    -Fixed triangulation algorithm (should not crash anymore)
    -Added full plane triangulation
    -Checks in all Selection-Dialogs, if cancel was pressed
    -Added calculation of intersection line of Wing and Fuselage
    -The recently opened folder is now saved


Version 2.0.1

-Fixed geometry transformations like sweep angle and dihedral angle rotating sections
-Fixed scalings that lead to a translation of sections
-Datasets with CPACS Version < 2.0 are now rejected
-Calculation of fused fuselage, wing, and airplane should not crash anymore
-Removed memory leaks
-Cmake based project files
-Prepared for OpenCascade? 6.5.3
-Windows 64 Bit builds available
-TIGLViewer:
    -Fixed inconsistent hot keys and menu entries for views
    -Console window showing outputs of TIGL and OpenCascade?
    -Wireframe mode
    -Recent Documents menu entry


Version 2.0

-Compatible with CPACS 2.0
-Corrected the implicit rotation of fuselage and wing profiles. They shouldn't turn from x-y to x-z by TIGL
-TIGL now uses the coordinate system of parent components for child components. This is only done when parent --> child 
 relations could be figured out via UIDs.
-Profile points could now also be stored as the vector (x ,y, and z) containing all profile points.
-Some XPath have changed in CPACS 2.0, for example "sweepangle" is now "sweepAngle". TIGL is taking care of these changes.
-New TIGL Functions
    -tiglFuselageGetSymmetry and tiglWingGetSymmetry for querying symmetry information
    -tiglWingGetReferenceArea gives the reference area of a wing
    -tiglWingComponentSegmentFindSegment returns the segmentUID and wingUID for a given point on a componentSegment
    -tiglWingGetWettedArea a new function for caluclating wetted area of a wing
    -tiglWingComponentSegmentPointGetSegmentEtaXsireturns eta, xsi, segmentUID and wingUID for a given eta and xsi on 
     a componentSegment
-TIGLViewer
    -Complete rebuild of TIGLViewer. It is now QT based and platform independent
    -TIGLViewer now updates the view when the cpacs file is changed.


Version 1.0

-New Functions
    -tiglComponentIntersectionPoint Returns a point on the intersection line of two geometric components. Often 
     there are more one intersection line, therefore you need to specify the line.
    -tiglComponentIntersectionLineCount Returns the number if intersection lines of two geometric components.
    -tiglComponentGetHashCode Computes a hash value to represent a specific shape. The value 
     is computed from the value of the underlying shape reference and the Orientation is not taken into account.
    -tiglFuselageGetMinumumDistanceToGround Returns the point where the distance between the selected fuselage 
     and the ground is at minimum. Fuselage could be turned with a given angle at at given axis, specified by a 
     point and a direction.
-Changes
    -tiglOpenCpacsConfiguration now opens a configuration without specification if the uid if it is the only one 
     in the data set. Simply take NULL or en empty string as uid argument.
    -Added a Python wrapper for the C-code and DLL handling (no need to manually convert cpython variables to python)
-TIGLViewer
    -TIGLViewer now could draw the componentSegment of a selected wing.


Version 0.9

-Fixed a bug that leads to strange errors when the first positioning of a Wing is not in the origin and has not 
 innerSectionUID-element.
-Removed annoying strErr message when a point miss one parameter.
-TIGL 64-Bit libs are available for linux.
-TIGL is now able to open rotocraft configurations as well as aircraft
