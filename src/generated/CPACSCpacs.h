    /// 2. Coordinate Systems
    /// Coordinate systems are a regular cause for ambiguous interpretation of data. In CPACS only the CPACS-coordinate system is valid. The following paragraphs outline the determination to known coordinate systems.
    /// The CPACS coordinate system is the coordinate system identified by TIGL, CPACS's geometric library. It is a right-handed coordinate system. If an aircraft is defined in the CPACS coordinate system it will usually follow the directions listed in the table below.
    /// Therefore, the CPACS coordinate system can be confused with the body-fixed coordinate system. While often the CPACS coordinate system and the body-fixed coordinate system overlap, this must not always be true. Several definitions for body-fixed coordinate systems exist (x-axis through nose and tail, x-axis perpendicular to nose plane). For non-symmetric aircraft, body-fixed coordinate systems become even more complicated. Hence, analysis tools should stick to the CPACS-Coordinate system. It remains to the designer to model the geometry accordingly.
    /// The CPACS coordinate system does not rotate with flow. Hence, aerodynamic calculations do rotate their flow relative to the CPACS-coordinate system. If not stated explicitly different, e.g. for target lift-coefficients, results are returned in the CPACS coordinate system, i.e. the cfx-coefficient is parrallel to the CPACS x-Coordinate, regardless of the way the geometry is defined.
    /// The following table gives an "best-practice" advice on how to locate a geometry within CPACS. Different approaches are, of course, valid as well.
    /// Axis Direction Description x tailwards from nose to tail y spanwise from symmetry plane to the right wingtip z upwards from landing gear to tip of vertical tailplane The following pictures give an example for a geometry that is defined in alignment with the CPACS coordinate system, i.e. the body coordinate system overlaps with the CPACS coordinate system.
    /// @see cosys01
    /// The aerodynamic analysis is relative to the CPACS coordinate system. That is, the angle of attack is represented by the dashed orange line. Results of the aerodynamic calculation are given in the CPACS coordinate system.
    /// @see cosys02
    /// The following pictures give an example for a geometry that is not defined in alignment with the CPACS coordinate system. It is a valid CPACS file, but chosen here for demonstrative purposes.
    /// @see cosys1
    /// The body axes and the CPACS coordinate system do not align. That is, the origin of the geometry is not at CPACS (0,0,0) but at a point in positive x- and z-direction.
    /// @see cosys2
    /// Again, the aerodynamic analysis is relative to the CPACS coordinate system. That is, the angle of attack is represented by the dashed orange line. Results of the aerodynamic calculation are given in the CPACS coordinate system.
    /// 3. Units
    /// There are no explicit attributes describing units in CPACS. The general convention is that all values must be given in the following SI-units:
    /// [m] Position, Distance [m] [m] Area [m] [m] Volume [kg] Mass [s] Time [K] Temperature [°] Angle or in derived units, e.g.:
    /// [N] Force [Nm] Moment [W] Power [J] Energy 4. Splitting up a CPACS dataset into several files
    /// To provide a better overview, it is possible to split up a  dataset into several files. This can be done by inserting an  node at an arbitrary position into the datatset.

Its content is analogous to the &lt;externaldata&gt;'s &lt;path&gt;node described above. externalDataNodePath - XPATH of the node which is replaced with the content of the external file. In case that it is an external file of an external file, then it is the XPATH in the outer external file. If, e.g., in the example above the &lt;pointList&gt;node would have also been loaded from an external file, then the entry would just be: externalDataNodePath="/airfoil". This is used primarily for loop-detection. The single tree for the example above would look like:

    /// &lt;cpacs&gt; 5. UIDs and references
    /// The -dataset often uses references between nodes. Typically, these references define connections between parts that are located somewhere else in the dataset (e.g. a wing is connected to a fuselage, a specific engine from the "engines"-section is used, ...). These connections are made, using UID attributes. This means, that a node, that shall be referenced (e.g. an engine type, an airfoil geometry, a mission definition, ...), gets an additional UID attribute, consisting of a unique (in the scope of the whole  dataset) text, like: CPACS The -dataset often uses references between nodes. Typically, these references define connections between parts that are located somewhere else in the dataset (e.g. a wing is connected to a fuselage, a specific engine from the "engines"-section is used, ...). These connections are made, using UID attributes. This means, that a node, that shall be referenced (e.g. an engine type, an airfoil geometry, a mission definition, ...), gets an additional UID attribute, consisting of a unique (in the scope of the whole  dataset) text, like: CPACS The -dataset often uses references between nodes.

These connections are made, using UID attributes. This means, that a node, that shall be referenced (e.g. an engine type, an airfoil geometry, a mission definition, ...), gets an additional UID attribute, consisting of a unique (in the scope of the whole  dataset) text, like:
    /// &lt;fuselage uID="ATTAS fuselage"&gt;... Such a node with a UID is then typically referred to by a subnode, like:
    /// &lt;wing&gt;
    /// &lt;name&gt;ATTAS main wing&lt;/name&gt;
    /// &lt;parentUID isLink="True"&gt;ATTAS fuselage&lt;/parentUID&gt;
    /// ... It is absolutely essential to ensure that a UID attribute is unique within the whole dataset, as searching for this name is the only way to resolve the reference!
    /// This is also important for testing. All nodes that refer to an UID like e.g. parentUID carry an additional attribute "isLink". If this attribute is true the dataset can be tested for valid UIDs.
    /// UID can either be named according to their appearance in the hierarchy e.g. uid=""mainWingKinkSection" or by automatically placing identifiers e.g. via processor runtime dates
    /// 6. Symmetry
    /// Sometimes it might be useful to specify a part of the aircraft as symmetric instead of holding all the data twice in nearly identical form in the dataset (e.g. left and right wing are usually identical, except for the sign of the y-coordinate). Hence, some parts offer the option to set a symmetry attribute for them, like:
    /// &lt;wing symmetry="x-z-plane"&gt;... This attribute explains that the whole part with all its subnodes is symmetric to the given plane. Possible planes are: x-y-plane x-z-plane y-z-plane This attribute explains that the whole part with all its subnodes is symmetric to the given plane. Possible planes are:
    /// UIDs, references and symmetry All nodes, e.g. parentUID, in CPACS that refer to a component that holds symmetry attribute, e.g. wing, have to carry the symmetry attribute as well.
    /// The symmetry attribute may take three values: symm, def, full: def: The element refers to the geometric component that has a symmetry attribute and refers only to the defined side of the geometric component. symm: The element refers to the geometric component that has a symmetry attribute and refers only to the symmetric side of the geometric component. (Similar to the previous _symm solution) full: The element refers to the geometric component that has a symmetry attribute and refers to the complete component. (This is the default behaviour) The symmetry attribute may take three values: symm, def, full:
    /// &lt;wing uID="ATTAS main wing" symmetry="x-z-plane"&gt;
    /// ...
    /// &lt;segments&gt;
    /// &lt;segment uID="ATTAS main wing innersegment"&gt;
    /// ... In the example above, to refer to the "other" side of the wing on must use the definition as such:
    /// &lt;loadcase&gt;
    /// ...
    /// &lt;segments&gt;
    /// &lt;segment&gt;
    /// &lt;segmentUID isLink="True" symmetry="symm"&gt;ATTAS main wing inner segment&lt;/segmentUID&gt;
    /// &lt;strip&gt;... 7. Arrays and vectors
    /// For bigger datasets (e.g. aerodynamic or engine performance maps), it is better to insert a vector or an array of values instead of providing a single node for each data value. In , there are  and  for this purpose.

    /// The  attribute specifies the type of data. It can have the following value: mapType The  attribute specifies the type of data. It can have the following value: mapType="vector" The vector is meant as a one-dimensional-array. In such a node, the values are contained in a semicolon separated list:

Again, the values are contained in a semicolon separated list. An array is always preceded by a sequence of vectors, containing the dimensions and index values of it:
    /// mapType="array" &lt;machNumber mapType="vector"&gt;0.5&lt;/machNumber&gt;
    /// &lt;altitude mapType="vector"&gt;1000.;2000.&lt;/altitude&gt;
    /// &lt;angleOfSideslip mapType="vector"&gt;-5.;0.;5.&lt;/angleOfSideslip&gt;

The array above is also shown in the following tables:
    /// mapType="array" Value for cfx, Mach number: 0.5, Altitude: 1000m
    /// Angle of attack = 1.° Angle of attack = 2.° Angle of attack = 3.° Angle of attack = 4.° Angle of Sideslip = -5.° 1. 2. 3. 4. Angle of Sideslip = 0.° 11. 12. 13. 14. Angle of Sideslip = 5.° 21. 22. 23. 24. mapType="array" Value for cfx, Mach number: 0.5, Altitude: 2000m

Angle of Sideslip = 5.° 121. 122. 123. 124. mapType="array" The  attribute specifies the type of data. It can have the following value:
    /// 
    /// 8. Atmosphere
    /// At some places in CPACS, an atmosphere has to be selected (e.g. for connecting an altitude with a certain pressure or density).

    /// In CPACS, 'altitude' means what is called 'geopotential altitude' (H) in the ISA reference document and is given in [m].
    /// For details, see ISA manual, section 2.3, page E-viii f.
    /// ISA covers a range from -5000 m to 80000 m.
    /// Temperature offsets are introduced on top of the definitions in the ISA manual (which does not cover such variations). The offset model
    /// is based upon the idea that the pressure at a fixed geopotential altitude is independent from temperature offset (pressure altitude).

That is the initial coordinate system in which geometries are defined. Therefore, it can but must not meet your body axis. the mass breakdown is extended for a more detailed wing strucuture profiles can now be included based on a two-dimensional class shape transformation. The old parametrization will still be available. TIGL will learn CST asap. all issues can be found online http://code.google.com/p/cpacs/issues/list CPACS 2.01
    /// Release in Nov 2012
    /// CPACS 2.01 is an internal release for the VAMP project. It is the testbed for CPACS 2.1 included fuselage structure additions to the load case definition all issues can be found online http://code.google.com/p/cpacs/issues/list CPACS 2.0
    /// Release in Mar 2012
    /// CPACS 2.0 is the first public release large impacts on the documentation all issues can be found online http://code.google.com/p/cpacs/issues/list compatible with TIGL 2.0 excluded fuselage structure, reintegration in CPACS 2.1 CPACS 1.6
    /// Release in Jul 2011
    /// Thanks for the input on the documentation to Felix Dorbath, Till Pfeiffer, Alexander Koch, Falk Heinecke and Tom Otten preliminary added enginePylons deleted seatAssemblyPositionType updated toolspecific blocks from handbook aero and cpacs mass updater added weight and balance definition added loads reference axis and dynamic aircraft model added wing documentation added weights documentation added fleet documentation added paramam toolspecific documentation added wing tank definition changed some names in the massBreakdown deleted old loadCaseDefinitions no more plural element for loadAnalyses shifted groundforces to groundloadcases, this will need an update added noseLandingGear mainLandingGear can now have plural SideStruts CPACS 1.5
    /// Release in Feb 2011
    /// uID for transformation extended stringUIDBaseType with optional attribute isLink all elements xxxUID are now of Type stringUIDBaseType added new material definition from FA to distinguish between diffent material types changed fuselage structure definition due to input from BK changed rib definition in cells in component segments cleaned up material definition in component segments added cpacsVersion information to the header and updates types added area and length to the loadCase reference on wing strips added wingFuselageAttachment CPACS 1.4
    /// Release in Nov 2010
    /// Geometry definition for engine and nacelle added Trailing Edge Devices, Leading Edge Devices and Spoilers added Rotorcraft added, similar to aircraft Splitted up multiple Point Types sparCell added uID new inline Documentation introduced in CPACS type CPACS 1.3
    /// Release in Aug 2010
    /// Fuel definition added Introduced component segments for the wing structure Mission definition was updated VSAero toolspecific data updated CPACS 1.2
    /// Release in May 2010
    /// Fuselage Structure Elements are updated following the input from BK stringers&gt;arbitrary additional parameters: yBezugAtStartX, zBezugAtStartX, yBezugAtEndX, zBezugAtEndX paxCrossBeams additional parameters: startX, endX cargoCrossBeams additional parameters: startX, endX paxCrossBeamStruts additional parameters: startX, endX cargoCrossBeamStruts additional parameters: startX, endX structure&gt;pressureBulkhead: positionX instead of positionZ reinforcementNumberVertical: number of vertical reinforcements reinforcementNumberHorizontal: number of horizontal reinforcements maxFlectionDepth: max camber of pressure bulkhead reinforcementNumber: number of reinforcements rear pressure bulkhead sheetProperties: definition of sheet properties innerRadius: inner radius of the pressure bulkhead Dummy Wingbox element is included. This definition needs further enhancements cpacs&gt;vehicles&gt;aircraft&gt;model&gt;fuselage&gt;fuselage&gt;structure Wingbox: xStart: start of the wingbox area xEnd: end of the wingbox area zStart: upper limit of the wingbox area Damping Derivaties are added in the form of dcfxdp, dcfxdq, dcfxdr, dcfydp, etc. The data will be stored in the model/global/aeroperformaneMap under a new dampingDerivatives element. Unit is deg/sec. StructureProfiles are defined in the profiles element. They are referenced in structuralElements for several entities such as stringer, frame etc. Currently they are referenced via 'structuralProfileUID' for name consistency it should be either only 'structure' or only 'structural' Control Commmands. The chain between pilot inputs and controlsurface deflections is now closed. Parameters located at cpacs\vehicles\aircraft\model\systems cockpitControl: links from pilotInput to commandCase commandCase: links from commandCase to controlDistributor or controlFunction controlDistributor links to the controlSurface controlLaws includes controlModes automatic and manual controlModes contain controlFunctions TraFuMo toolspecific data added CPACS 1.1
    /// Release in Feb 2010
    /// Fleets model added. The fleets modeling from CATS is introduced to CPACS 1.1 Reference changed. The reference type in wingSegmentStripCoefficientsType was changed from referenceType to pointType
